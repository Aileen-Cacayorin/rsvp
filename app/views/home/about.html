  <h1 class="text-center">About RSVP</h1>

<h3>Inspiration</h3>
  <p>One of our team members, Shannon, told us about her personal experiences and pain with family gatherings. She told us of her father and a manila folder he would carry and constantly consult for family arrivals and lodging locations. While the folder-solution for her father was successful, it was a delicate construct that was only decipherable by him alone. With our team, we discussed an event manager that could put this information into one place that would be more user-friendly. A dashboard where the planner type can wrangle the loose family ends into one easy to understand interface that can be shared and updated between attending members.</p>

<h3>What it does</h3>
  <p>Users can come at RSVP from two directions. The first as an event manager. A user can create a new event, invite guests, and list the details of the event. The second way for a user to interact is as a guest. A guest is invited to an event via email (like a slack invitation) where they can log in and view the event. Guests can review lodging details for each guest and can even find lodging deals displayed through the site via Expedia's Hotel API. Guests' lodging details are recorded and displayed for other guests to see.</p>

<h3>How we built it</h3>
  <p>Rails, Ruby, Bootstrap, Expedia Hotel API, Google Maps API, and love.</p>

<h3>Challenges we ran into</h3>
  <p>Smooth sailing with team RSVP, always.</p>

<h3>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h3>
  <p>Launching the live project on Heroku with Mailers is always exciting at a hackathon. We're also proud that we were able to wrangle the Expedia APIs for displaying relevant hotel information for guests to reference in their own purchases.</p>

<h3>What we learned</h3>
  <p>We learned that a squad of five Rails developers can very quickly produce a prototype we're all happy to present.</p>

<h3>What's next for RSVP</h3>
  <p>RSVP will go in two directions. The first is as a wedding planning tool, headed by one of our members, Aileen. The second is in the more general direction for any event, headed by our very own Jake.</p>
